  Explorer brings series (one-dimensional) and dataframes (two-dimensional)
  for fast data exploration to Elixir.

  Most of the functionality in `Explorer` is in `Explorer.DataFrame` and
  `Explorer.Series`. To write elegant and expressive queries, see
  `Explorer.Query`. Refer to those modules for more in-depth documentation.
